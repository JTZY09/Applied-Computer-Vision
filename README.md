Speed Detection System
Overview
This repository contains a Speed Detection System built using OpenCV. The system calculates the speed of moving objects in video feeds by analyzing frame differences and applying contour detection techniques. It was developed as part of an Applied Computer Vision course project to showcase real-world applications of computer vision.

Features
Object Tracking: Detect and track moving objects in video feeds.
Speed Calculation: Measure object speeds based on frame rate and displacement.
Contour Detection: Accurately identify objects in motion.
Technologies
Python
OpenCV
How It Works
Frame Differencing: The system captures two consecutive frames to detect motion.
Contour Detection: Motion is analyzed using contour detection to identify moving objects.
Speed Calculation: The displacement of tracked objects across frames is measured, and speed is calculated using the frame rate.
Dependencies
